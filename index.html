    <h1>How to improve your basketball shooting</h1> <img src="https://www.basketballworkouttips.com/wp-content/uploads/Stephen-Curry-shooting-form-2.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry">
	<h3>Learning how to shoot a basketball doesn't come naturally to everyone.
	In most cases, mastering the skill takes advice from coaches and elders, along with hours of practice.</h3>
	<br>
	<h2>B.L.E.S.H.</h2>
	<p>The creator of the camp, Frank Allocco Sr., was the head coach of the men's basketball team at De La Salle High School in Concord,
 California, for 18 seasons. He led the school to 17 East Bay Athletic League titles and two state championships.</p>

	<p>In 2014, Allocco Sr. was named the associate head coach at the University of San Francisco. He also played football and basketball
 at the University of Notre Dame in the 1970s. In short, Allocco Sr. knows a thing or two about basketball.</p>

	<p>To begin, hold the ball in the palm of your hand with a small amount of space between your skin and the ball.
 Both your wrist and elbow should be bent at about 90 degrees.</p>

	<p>Your feet should be about shoulder-width apart, and the foot of your shooting hand should be slightly ahead of your other foot. 
If you were to slide your other foot over, the ball of this foot would fit like a puzzle piece with the arch of the foot on your shooting-hand side.
 Additionally, both feet should be directly facing the basket.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Steps:</h2>
	<ol> 
		  <li><h3>Bend</h3></li> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PeSeGFAFoOs/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Bend">
		  <p>Bend your knees to about a quarter-squat. As you lower your body, try to maintain the 90-degree angle in both your wrist and elbow.</p>
		  <li><h3>Lift</h3></li> <img src="http://www.humankinetics.com/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/087/37ph1_MPreview.jpg" alt="Lift">
		  <p>Simultaneously lift your legs and arms you transition into the actual jumping and shooting motion.
		  Try to maintain the 90-degree angle in your wrist and elbow until the next step.</p>
		  <li><h3>Extend</h3></li> <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/850/1*oRZbkR6PqzyllikERT9Tbw.jpeg" alt="Extend">
		  <p>As you leave the ground and enter the arbone portion of the shot, begin extending your shooting arm upward and slightly forward.</p>
		  <li><h3>Snap</h3></li> <img src="http://www.hoopskills.com/content/proper-basketball-shooting-form.jpg" alt="Snap">
		  <p>As your arm nears full-extenstion, snap your wrist to catapult the basketball towards the hoop.
		  By doing that, backspin should be generated which can boost the ball to fall in the basket.</p>
		  <li><h3>Hold</h3></li> <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/90/a5/d1/90a5d1751208546eec8a23e4801202d3.jpg" alt="Hold">
		  <p>To finish the shot motion, hold your follow-through. Your wrist should be fully bent in the end possition, and your fingers (primarily the index and middle fingers) should be in line with the basket.</p>
    </ol>
	
    <h2>Additional tips:</h2>
	<ul> 
		  <li>Your off-hand should be used strictly for balance purposes and should not be a part of the actual shooting motion</li> 
		  <li>Be cautious of your thumb on your off-hand. A common mistake for young players is to flick the thumb in an effort to generate more power</li>
		  <li>If you're struggling to keep your off-hand out of the shooting motion, work on your shooting with one hand a few feet away from the basket</li>
	</ul>
